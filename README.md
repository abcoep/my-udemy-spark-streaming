# My repo for the Spark Streaming with Scala course on Udemy

This repository contains my hands on code and exercise solutions wrote during the [Apache Spark Streaming 3 with Scala | Rock the JVM](https://www.udemy.com/course/spark-streaming/) course on Udemy.

## How to install

- install Docker
- either clone the repo or download as zip
- open with IntelliJ as an SBT project
- in a terminal window, navigate to the folder where you downloaded this repo and run `docker-compose up` to build and start the containers - we will need them to integrate various stuff e.g. Kafka with Spark
